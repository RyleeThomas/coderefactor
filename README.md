CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

For this week's Challenge, my task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. 

To impress the imaginary client for this Challenge I ensured that all links are functioning correctly and cleaned up the CSS to make it more efficient, such as by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
